RE: Claim Processing Notification

Dear Michael Johnson,

We have processed your claim for services received on February 28, 2024,
from Houston Orthopedic Associates.

CLAIM STATUS: DENIED

Reason for Denial: The claim was submitted with an invalid modifier
combination. CPT code 29881 (knee arthroscopy) was billed with modifier 59,
but the documentation does not support a distinct procedural service.

The claim also shows a possible NPI mismatch. The billing NPI does not
match our records for the rendering provider.

Service Details:
- CPT Code: 29881
- Modifier: 59
- Provider: Dr. Sarah Chen
- Date of Service: 02/28/2024

Amounts:
- Billed Amount: $4,200.00
- Allowed Amount: $0.00
- Member Responsibility: $4,200.00

NEXT STEPS

Please contact your provider's billing department to:
1. Review and correct the modifier usage
2. Verify the correct NPI is on file
3. Resubmit the corrected claim

Timely Filing: Corrected claims must be submitted within 90 days of this notice.
